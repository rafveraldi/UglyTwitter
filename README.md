# Ugly - Twitter clone

As I kindly named it: **Ugly** is an *uglier and simpler but fully funcional*
Twitter Clone web application.

It doesn't look as pretty as the original, but you can still do CRUD operations for the following:

- Account
- Tweet
- Follow
- Comment
- Like

It started as a backend API that can be used by any frontend developer for educational purposes and became a full web application as I took advantage of AI's help on generating HTML page templates.

The API can still be used by another frontend application separately as all endpoints are available.

**Ugly** uses:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the main programming language;
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the backend;
- [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) as template engine for HTML+CSS server-side generated pages and partials;
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic interactions and DOM manipulations;
